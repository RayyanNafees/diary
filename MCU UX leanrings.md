## 1. User Centricity
- Connect to the users on a deeper level
- have your startup story that relates to them
- VC might find your story relatable if you present a startup story that they (or everyone in general) wants to have
- They might feel connection (and this is a must.. customer connections ) and trust the company more
- As in _"I also had a similar dream, since i couldnt eachieve it, i'll fund it to get it done by someone i trust having the same background as me. If only I had the support at that time, i would have achieved it, so lemme support it when I can! "_

## 2. UI consistency
- Have a consistent UI acrosss all your projects
- And also try somehow connecting all your projects into one
