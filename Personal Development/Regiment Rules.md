### Principles
- act with urgency
- do what you say you will
- show up on time
- close the loop
```js
for (let i =0; i< Math.Infinity; i++); // closed with a ';'
```
- people remember how you make them feel
- consistency breeds excellence
- ship something everyday
- exercise everyday
- it's a marathon, not a sprint
- surround yourself with people who are better than you are
- make friends on the internet
- work harder than you think you should
- if it's under an hour, walk
- you're not above anything
- you're not below anything
- great outfits should be repeated
- taste is a muscle
- sweat the details
- a lot of things matter a little
- a few things matter a lot
