Use When u are in a setting of no respect, don't go in a group where u are not respected, else u would end up being a people pleaser for them, and they would be the unpleased no matter what u do

Becoming a People Magnet from a People Pleaser
## 3 things needed to be respected in a group
1. How useful u are to the group (telling u how replaceable u are)
2. Body Language & fitness (How tough u are, train well)
3. Speaking (Learn the Psychology of Speech, a 2 yr old can speak like a 40 and people will respect it rather than a 40 yr old talking like a 2)

## Grouping

Create your own group at what u are best at (or want to be best at), with people who are interested in the same field to respect u for the skills
## Serve the community

Create things that serve the community well, making people having to respect u by force

## Do not tolerate disrespecting people just cuz u should

Respect is not imposed, it is earned by a person from a person, and a similar way can be ruined

Don't make the other person the authority to judge if u should be respected or not, instead be the judge yourself if a person deserve your respect & time or is he just a useless junk providing no value to your time
## Leave the Junks, and pursue the Heights

Stop wasting time in a group or with people who don't respect your presence or time (especially those who can't give u respect in front of other people)

There are many better people in the world u can shine with, life is short, your time is limited, make the best use of it in pursuing new heights with a group where u will shine 

Be it with people who have already achieved those heights and can support u reach there, or people that will add value to your persona by their _sangati_ -  Remember, u are the product of the last 5 people u be with, pick the right ones 

## Understand the Psychology 

Human brain is the only thing used to control other humans, learn how it works, control it, and that's how u play the game. U can win only after knowing how the game is played. Learn it from books or podcasts

## Train your Brain 
- By Playing Games like chess to strategize your moves on how to achieve anything and looking past into what's apparent
- By diving into Maths and finding out ways to figure out outcomes
- By investing into Psychology & Philosophy to understand the nature of human societies
- By learning the art of Speech from the Quran after learning it and keeping u reality checked of who gives respect & disrespect ☝️


## Train your Muscles

God has blessed u by giving u an empty room where u can be yourself all day

1. Order a Hand Grip Increaser that u can use in schools,
2. Buy a Skipping Rope for getting fit faster like explained in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bm56LgM2rVw)
	- Or u can buy a [Parallet](https://youtu.be/T2aDAvMi_Jo?si=9D3uzTANNVGM6qmQ) as well
3. Get your cycle repaired 
4. 10 pushups per hour
5. Pull ups if possible

## Secrecy 

Never share your secrets, as that not only lowers your values, but also lets people find an opening to take advantage from.

Don't layout everything u do out in open for others to see and give an evil eye on
If u are to show it, show it to the masses as a content creator
If it's not that good to show, keep it private, have a personal life

Reduce the social media as much as possible, u are not here to prove yourself or please others. But to achieve the heights and win.

Spend your free time into acheiving excellence
