### Vercel back to Node 
1. Vercel is back on Node.js after their Edge Runtime hype... 
1. Sometimes it's good to not to indulge in overtly complex things unless u have to
1. Always test & benchmark & crosscheck the proposal.. don't fool for marketing and social media hype
1. Use the core technologies if they work
	> **Avoid unnecessary complexity for insignificant benefits unless u have to**
### Track time hourly with daily reviews
- U need to track your time atleast every hour on what u did this hour and have a daily hourly track list ready... if only i knew some apps that did so
### Terminal Icons
- Things can be editted via `Set-TerminalIconsIcon` cli, thanks to [carapace](https://rsteube.github.io/carapace-bin/) which provides terminal cli hints
### Make up for wasted time first
- Avoid wasting time with friends or heavily back up the wasted time
### [[AI chat]] 
- Gemini chat client for boosting productivity
### **Rust for WASM**
- Golang is not fit for WASM, only C & Rust is.... cuz of no garbage collection, and that too has less adoption on web
### [$4B Firebase security breach](https://youtu.be/TKyNPg7UIIc?si=5001c9j-gSMIQRBg)
- Firebase is very unsecure being client first
- Never avoid security rules
- Always try using a bundler like vite with it or use a backend that uses firebase isntead
- Try pen-testing firebase websites.. learn from [tryhackme](tryhackme.com) or smth
### [**2D Godot**:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwCiGixlqiU) 
- 2D game development basics in Godot
- Godot events (snapshots/singleton)
- Layer & Mask of Area2D & CollisionBody2D
- Camera & CanvasLayer

1. **Over Confidence**: Don't always think you're the only chad in the room, there may be many silent kids u wont know.. never underestimate your competitors
### [Expo Orbit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwCiGixlqiU)
1. Doesn't need Android Studio installed if can recognize the `android` cli
2. Instantly starts up expo apps
3. Expo 51 (beta) uses react-native v0.74 which is fast af by 0.73
4. [op-sqlite](https://youtu.be/RO_2onGikyY?si=-Uwv_UUAzoQeTb5g) outperforms MMKV
### [Dua from Allah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N73nLneCj5U)
-  Allah loves dua.. will make things happen for u if u ask.. even if it seems not right.. But doing Du'a in Sajdah, makes miracles happen
-  Do 7 Subhan Rabbi'al A'ala in Sajda.. that's when u're the closest.. ask there
-  Be Disciplined with 5 daily prayers & leave all the stress upon God
- Your Dua wont be accepted no matter what u do if u have haram clothing, haram food etc.. always be Halal
- 
> *"O My servant, come towards me walking, And I'll come towards to at speed"*
### [Signs from Allah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IA0gHz4wJ4)
 - Always have Tawakkul in his plans
- He makes ppl distant from u cuz they were not right for u
-  It's only when u look at OTHER places, letting go of what Allah has made distant from u, u'll realise what He has chosen for u.. and what He was leading u towards instead
### **[Argumentativeness](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnjOQgEpdUA)**: 
#### Problem:
0. Allah hates the the person who strives to have the final word in an argument
1. The likes of such was compared to the hypocrites.. and criticized in Quran
2. Such a person can never reach the truth
3. The main cause of it is PRIDE
4. Such a person thinks he can never be wrong... while it's the biggest foolishness.. 
5. It's only when we know our mistakes, we upgrade, improve and Evolve.. and that can't be happen without the possibility of being wrong
#### Solution
7. Instead listen carefully what point the person is trying to make
8. Don't indulge in argument just for the sake of it or to satisfy your ego
9. Strive if the other person can be on truth so that u may be sincere on finding it
10. Focus on the outcome whenever talking, what u are trying to achieve instead of just for talking and chit-chating
### Notion Sites for [Project Documentation](https://ospfranco.notion.site/OP-SQLite-Documentation-a279a52102464d0cb13c3fa230d2f2dc)
- Try to have all Changelogs, Blogs & Plans of ***Elite-Club*** organized into Notion & published as Notion Sites
### [Explore & Exploit Productivity Tips](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsMHicoZTzQ)
- Have more work in Prototyping (Explore) phase & More content in Product phase
- At all parts first priority is Prototyping (get the basic-est idea working) in whichever tech stack u can work in the easiest.. no matter how bad or slow it'd be.. u can always optimize it later
- Early Optimizations, UI/UX, "frameworks" & other overengineering kill the project, leave it for Productive phase after prototyping is done 
### Sidekick Browser
### Surrealist: SurrealDB web admin
- Try if u can make the same for postgres, redis etc
- Would be web based and desktop server will be interacted using `ssh`, just as how serveo.net works
- Clone serveo repo and dive deep into how things like that works


## Things to Search

- [ ] A time tracker app like StayFree browser extension but for Desktops
- [ ] Best dairy theme for Astro
- [ ] A sync cli that syncs files based on changes.. watches directories or executes a cron to github every schedule ([restic]( https://restic.net) maybe)
- [ ] Github webhooks that whenever u push some changes to your [diary](https://github.com/RayyanNafees/diary) repo, it clones it to another Astro repo that then builds the website out of the md content collections
