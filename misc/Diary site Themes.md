These are the themes I've considered for my project
While this directory will be having a Astro Starlight theme

The choice will be made based on the following criteria
- Can show images with the posts
- A nice "Archives" tab UI for daily updates
- Tag support telling how much posts done on a particular topic
- Projects folder for showing my projects
