a Rust's Actix-Web/yew/Leptos/Axum based pocketbase alternative with better performance than go's Pocketbase

Or just Pocketbase but using a faster and better framework like Go-Fiber or Fast-HTTP and gopher.js on frontend

Or just like Astro's compiler - A WASM based pocketbase alternative 

Or anything that just beats pocketbase in performance and scalability

Provides features like Lite-Stream & Turso Sync, S3 buckets, Auth using goth / go-true etcetera

And all the features of SQL at its peak using [sqlpkg](https://sqlpkg.org/all/)

For performance reasons make them to be turned off or on for the project and carefully benchmark the bottlenecks and edge-cases or The impact they have on performance, memory/CPU consumption & Scalability
