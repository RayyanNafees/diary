Deploying and Maintaining Open Source DB, tools, services to the cloud and making them available as a better SDK integrating with existing software tools etc

Using all the services awesome about them into individual services with great DX
eg, adding all services from awesome-postgres for example postgis, ferretdb, postgraphile and giving them as cloud services with monitoring
...and doing so for all databases for example SQLite with all sqlpkg supports (user can choose)

Creating cheaper Base like Supabase clones that are easier to deploy and work with
