- A platform (inspired from Github) where students can upload their research etc. pics & videos & blog posts photos of their projects .. so others can star it so it can reach up (or pay you to show to promote it) mainly to attract more & more sponsors and investors 
- Gets them freelance gigs by scraping freelance, linkedin, shine, internshala, nokri.com, upwork etc 
- Gets them the ideas from the app-ideas subreddits or [[../100+ project ideas from buildspace.co|blog posts]] & product survey feedbacks for them to work
- Gets them the ideas faced by a company/investor with the prize they can get to solve it (including the hacking money chrome & instagram)

- Gives them a better interface for Smart India Hackathons, GSoC etc to come up and prepare for the ideas for upcoming hackathons easily.
