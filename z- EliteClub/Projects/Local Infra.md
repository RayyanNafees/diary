Local Infrastructure for running web apps

Basically servers and GPUs of AMU students, non-hackable system, distributed using SFTP & SSH with security concerns

Using Local Tunnels and other such networking technologies we create our own infra structure for free, mainly for the expensive stuff

High end gaming PC for the websites that need such requirements (also need to create a website requirements calculator somehow, maybe an AI would do... system design models etc)

Those with High GB Ram & more CPU cores and especially a GPU which are costly to do, to be employed for the work

The users who would rent their CPU resources will earn money, lesser than the usual costs, and it will be advised for the users who will use Local Infra to suffice the usage cost by adding ads to their websites... mainly mobile apps can earn alot with ads 

The listing for the new renters tp choose a GPU would be listed by the availabilty of the GPU

The user has to tunnel it regularly

We would also need to make software similar to [serveo](https://serveo.net) and [anon addy](https://addy.io) in hono to make everything work well
