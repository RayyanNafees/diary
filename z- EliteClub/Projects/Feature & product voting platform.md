Gets voting on what product to build next

Gets feedback on existing products and features

For individual apps, can vote on what features to prioritize in the next update

And can also vote on what features suck the most\

It fully describes the final end-user ideas we are planning to do (except the hardware ones) NOT how will we do it... cleverly hiding the technical details and meanwhile collecting genuine feedback on the product value

Also shows how much user traffic are we getting on apps to attract donators/funders or venture capitalists
