- Need to create the Modules for all the Classes in All the colleges of AMU along with their shit loads of Syllabus - Will need to integrate the data from AMU eLibrary API & Book Bank
- Just like PW batch modules, make for AMU related content
- Take help from professors or seniors to jot them down together on Obsidian etc
- Sync the Draft books to [LearnPub](https://learnpub.com) for other university Professors to get the early access drafts and provide feedbacks
- Would contain all the PYQs asked in AMU
- And will contain the summary of the relevant theory in AMU syllabus books that is asked in AMU and relevant for the field only
- Train an AI RAG on PW, Allen modules & HC verma like books to learn how to write a module with examples and theory mix such that suites the learning of the student
- After that, apply the RAG on the entire syllabus PDFs to generate the Template modules for the professors and teachers to review and edit
