To get govt recognition and contacts to professors, we need to create websites for them

The best way is to make use of their data from https://data.gov.in or to organize Hackathons based on this theme that whoever will make a useful app based on the data provided by the govt will win the award

Ask if u could get govt/community funds for the projects that might be useful for future etc
