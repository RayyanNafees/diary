Shows our various drone programs for various use cases
- 📚 Library Drones
- 🎮 Game 3D model enhancer drone
- 🛜 Router Drones - For managing networks between other drones
- ⛅ Sun-Sheild Drones
- 🌧️ Rain-Shield Drones
- ⛈️ Rain-man Cloudseeding drone
- 🔫 Air-Gun Drone - Drone packed with Air Guns, harmless-lasers, firecrackers & smoke screens (all harmless tools) ... mainly to be used with moneys 🐒
- 🤖 Cyborg Drone - Impossible (using real organism brain to train neural network and using his brain to guide the drone via organic neural networks)
- 🐍 Viper Drone - Moves & behaves like a snake to skill them
- 🛡️Drone-Shield - Shields other drones from outside damage
- 👁️Drone-Sense - AI based drones with sensitive sensors for protecting other drones, act as their eyes & ears for avoiding attacks
- 🪒Mower Drones - For lawn mowing & tree management, also for scaring away dogs & monkeys

Copy the workings of [Nerf Guns](https://youtube.com/shorts/iDLAp6pRCao?si=dhzWTTYIcJ4EX46I) & Water Guns or even SpaceX flame thrower and see if they can be used in the drones, just... for educational purpose

## Planned Designs 
- Manno Salva (QUAILS) - Food Delivery via drone 
- Air Printer - Send the Printer and pay the price, will print things down and drop them from above at the specified location 
- Insectivore - Sprays insecticides at the corners & toilets & trees/water ponds. Fine tuned to detect mosquitoes and Spider webs & drainage and water ponds for potential bugs
- Toilets System for knowing what toilets and bathrooms are occupied 
	- After its success will try making the same for library/reading room plugs which would be free 
- vlogger bot - Controlled by user and his facial expressions.. and shoots what he wants him tools 
	- Tracks the user movements and tries to keep all of it.. and also whom he's talking to 
	- Sound detection so the camera sees whoever speaks the loudest in the surrounding while still biased towards the host with more points
	- Records the user 360 degrees for others to watch (with VR functionality too)
- Driver - Drives the cycle with robotic limbs maintaining gyroscopic balance. For people to get their self driving cycles available at certain locations without them having to carry them around 
- Tracker Tape - Just hide the tape to your important phone's and laptops so u can track them and can't be seen, Can be implemented in any of the 3 ways
	- Connects to AMU WiFi with its mac address to track the GPS within AMU campus
	- Has a small magnetic SIM card that can be used to track the location 
	- Connects to our local UDP drone servers that would keep track of the tape's location
