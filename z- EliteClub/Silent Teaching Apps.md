Silent teaching apps for making students learn different concepts possible

employ AI if necessary to come up with method and those things that can be taught this way

Inspired by [Silent Teacher](https://silentteacher.toxicode.fr/)
There are also other [games by toxicode](https://www.toxicode.fr/learn) that teach programming, create similar experiences for both coding and academic subjects with games

# Terminal Sessions
use [Asciinema](https://asciinema.org/a/Ar31IoTkzsZmWWvlJll6p7haS) to teach terminal stuff and running APIs
Ask them to use them in your README.md to start the project's tutorials
And also in teaching various commands using them

For example use it to create DockerByExample or KubernetesByExample
Or anything from SQL to teaching a useful CLI like `atac` that can be run on a terminal..and teach them how to use them with the terminal output


# Coding Practice
Use [CodeAPI](https://github.com/nalgeon/codapi) to help them learn programming with as much examples as u can

Inspire from GOByExample, RustByExample and create GleamByExample or VbyExample or ElixirByExample sites for them to grab things easier

Or modify the existing byExample sites to an easier way like that Coding Tutor Game u played
