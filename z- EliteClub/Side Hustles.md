## [App Store / Play Store App Development](https://dev.to/lilxyzz/side-hustle-ideas-for-developers-in-2024-jh5#app-store-play-store-app-development)

Mobile app development is still thriving. As of 2023, the Google Play Store hosts approximately 3.718 million mobile apps, and the Apple App Store offers around 1.803 million iPhone apps. Using cross-platform tools and frameworks like React Native, Flutter, or Ionic, you can develop apps without learning native languages like Java/Kotlin or Swift.

Monetize your apps through ads, in-app purchases, or by offering a premium ad-free version with extra features. The mobile app market is a goldmine waiting for your innovative ideas.

Creating specialized, niche SaaS (Software as a Service) products can be incredibly profitable. Micro-SaaS products, often developed by solo developers or small teams, focus on very specific markets or functionalities.

Take inspiration from Raycast, a productivity tool that streamlines daily tasks and workflows with quick access and custom scripts. This small team's subscription-based model has turned into a huge success. Your unique Micro-SaaS product could be the next big thing!

Contributing to open-source projects is a fantastic way to showcase your skills, collaborate with other developers, and build your reputation. These contributions can lead to job offers, consulting gigs, or opportunities to sell your own tools and services.

If you start an open-source project that gains traction, you can monetize it through sponsorships, donations, or dual licensing, offering both a free community version and a paid commercial version with additional features or support.

AI is more than a buzzword; it's a booming market. In 2023, AI was valued at over $153.6 billion, and it's only getting bigger. Every week, new AI tools hit the market, offering endless opportunities for developers.

Imagine creating an AI-powered tool like AgentGPT, using large language models (LLMs) like [GPT](https://openai.com/index/gpt-4/), [Llama](https://llama.meta.com/), or [PaLM 2](https://ai.google/discover/palm2/). These tools break down user-defined goals into actionable tasks and execute them sequentially. Design a user-friendly interface to let users interact with the AI, define goals, monitor progress, and receive outputs. Monetize your creation with a subscription model, and watch the profits roll in as businesses and individuals pay for your time-saving solution.
