Just like [create-expo-stack](https://rn.new/?ref=dailydev) allows u to choose how u want to create your project with all the toolings and 3rd party tools that are used by the community with the framework as a convention (just like react + redux + axios did back in the days )

Create a CLI that can bootstrap not only frameworks but also stacks like `create-mern`

Especially those projects that require an IDE to be developed, CLIfy them... like android or Visual Studo ones

Take inspiration from astro etc

lIke `create-astro-stack` includes all the official and 3rd party but popular & new frameworks to be integrated

And also contains more templates (with images showing them into the terminal that supports images) for the user to copy while creating

Also comes with AI prompt using a Gemini API to precisely ask for the plugins and templates based on what the user is trying to achieve with the project
