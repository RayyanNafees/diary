### Roadmaps
- Roadmap.sh is the way to go
- Whenever u want to learn smth always prefer it to be your first choice for learning even before considering leet code 
- When teaching stuff at EliteClub AMU, teach the students in the way roadmap goes, ellaborating on it and taking doubts and giving lots of examples and excercises to do
	- Try each day if u can give each of them a project related to what was taught todayand 
		- Whosoever writes the project currectly with docs and comments and good coding practices and is able to explain it well will receive extra [[Stonks - Crypto Currency|Stonks]] 
	- This will work as shortnotes for them to pickup
	- and a guideline on what parts to teach and when to consider if the dude is ready
	- Also gives us guideline while taking [[Interview Prep|interviews]] that everything as per the roadmap basics is coverd and the guy has what we want

### JS

#### Promises

##### Promise Object 

- `Promsie.all` breaks the concurrent resolution on first encountering an `reeject` in any of its promise array 
- `Promise.any` breaks the concurrent resolution on first encountering a `resolve` in any of its promise array 
- `Promise.allSettled` never breaks and returns all the `resolve`d values and also the error values in case some `reject`, but it only gives values when all of the promises are settled

##### .finally()
- The `finally` block will be executed when the promise is `resolved` or `rejected`.

```js
promise
  .then((result) => {
    console.log(result);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.log(error.message);
  })
  .finally(() => {
    console.log('Finally Promise has settled');
  });
```

This is what one can do instead of awaiting the promise when it doesn't need to, just add the `setLoading(false)` in the `.finally(onSettled)`
- `onSettled` func runs despite if the promise hits an error or not, it A:WAYS RUNS AFTER THE PROMISE IS FULFILLED (by resolving or rejecting), the onfulfilled always runs after the promise ends
- `onSettled` return value doesnt matter unless it returns an error 
- `onSettled` takes no values (`.finally(v => console.log(v))` the `v` is always undefined, no arguments are passed to `.finally()`)
