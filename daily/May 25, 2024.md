## Backend
- gRPC is used for connecting different MicroServices for fast 2-way connections that can send to and from heavy data at low-latency utilising Protocol Buffers (Best for MicroServices where data needs to be taken from one service to another.. REST would have added their own latencies)
- Show only the First name of the individual if his name gets too long
- [Backend Courses](https://labs.iximiuz.com/courses) for CI/CD, Basic Networking , `containerd` cli
## Quran
- [Arabic Learning Practice course](https://arabicforbeginners.com/) small sololearn-like website for teaching arabic even includes Surahs & Juz
- [Root Word Finder](https://www.rootwordsofquran.com/Home/Details/91) for finding root arabic word in each of the Surah's to relate it better with Urdu for better learning
- U can learn the last 5 Juz in a month since most of the surahs are small or about 30-40 verses and the 25th para and beyond is very inspirational too
- Big Surahs planned to learn
	- Fajr
	- Juma
	- Rehman
	-  Zumar

## CSS

### Misc.
- `background-size: 10%` repeats the patter automatically
- `css-clip-path` can be used to draw any kind of repeating design 
- `radial-gradient` is what makes the center lighting and background shoadowed
- If moving items fade around the corners of a container as they come in and go out, it's probably a `radial-gradient` with transparent center on to of the moving items, and the non-center is the background of the `radial-gradient` behind them
### Minimal libs
- PicoCSS (9 KB)
- PureCSS (2 KB)
