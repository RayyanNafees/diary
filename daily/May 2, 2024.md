nothing fancy to write
Woke up early today
Learnt that easting less, training everyday, and having a proper bed time is very important
Take care of yourself alot, focus on being fit and healthy and the products u use and eat

Keep yourself maintained

Never talk to third-hand again .. ignore like it does.. until call comes or via socialmedia.. NEVER.. if u have any ounce of self respect left for yourself.. and if u love and care for your self even the slightest

Block amine for 3 months or less.. until u feel so happy and satisfied for yourself that her being there or not doesnt even count or matter

u need momentum to be speedy at anything.. try rolling a square on the ground.. it'd be the hardest and slowest.. over time.. on continuing it will mold it's vertices accordingly becoming a squircle.. and eventually becoming a circle with the passage of time --- which has the fastest and easiest movement.. --- CONSISTENCY BUILDS MOMENTUM

Whatever u think of doing, put the idea into action, just do it... start it.. even if it's insignificant as if writing "i dunno what to write" in a medium blog and putting on status

To be successful, 
- U need to have defined goals
- U need to figure out a proper strategy
- Don't have backup goals, but have a backup strategy
- Watch 7 ways to maximize misery daily after 8:30 and create a checklist of what things u avoid and what things u did today and why(write the why even if it's a "dunno")
- Picture the guy u want to be, describe the guy..write about it.. what qualities and attribute this guy has... what achievement he has earned and how.. and read it daily
