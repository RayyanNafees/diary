## Things Learnt Today

### 1. Github Actions
- `name` tells the name of the action upon running- ```
  on:
	  push:
		  branches: ['main']
	  pull_request:
		  branches: ['develop']```
  is the syntax for running the action on certain events

- `jobs` tells the actual aautomation commands group running inside the action, takes a list of jobs that can have a
	- `<job-id>` like `build` that would be running the actions
	- `runs-on` for telling the OS/image the job runs on
	- `strategy: matrix: node-versions: ['20.x', '22.x']` runs the jobon all of these versions
		- `matrix.node_versions` is also available as a global variable that can be used in other places down the action like `${{matrix.node-version}}` (returns which current node version the build was running on, since it runs on all of them in the matrix)
	-  `steps` most jobs are run asynchronously, steps runs the following run keywords inside of it synchronously, one after the other, each step has the following properties:
		- `name` for telling the name of the step
		- `uses` for using an exisiting action repository to use in the place
			- uses like `owner/repo@version_label` or `owner/repo@branch`
			- the repo needs to have an `action.yml` file that will be run whenever the `uses` mentions the action
			- used like this `uses: actions/checkout@v2`
			- This will run the `actions.yml` file in the `checkout` repo by `actions` owner (`actions/checkout` repo) with release version `v2`
		- `run` defines the actual command to run in the actions
		- `with` tells which node vresion to run the particular step on
### 2. Asciinema
- Used to record terminal sessions in a text file that can be played later by any other person
- Install on windows using the following command then set the alias to `asciinema` in $profile
```
scoop install powersession-rs agg
'Set-Alias asciinema PowerSession' >> $profile
```
- To record a session, type `PowerSession rec file.txt` (or `file.cast` being the convention), then it will record the video for u
- upon playing the commands are actually shown running inside the terminal as if they were real, but the commands have no effect, they just are shown inside the terminal as if someone was really typing the commands
- U can also upload the files to the server and link them inside a README.md or any other file for ppl to click that as a youtube thumbnail which would be redirected to asciinema hosted videos website where the terminal sessions will be hosted like a  videos
- U can also generate a loong (no time limit) GIF that will display your terminal sessions to the users using the  `agg` command , which can be easily embedded inside markdown
```
