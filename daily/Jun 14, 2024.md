## Things Learnt Today

### 1. Github Actions
- `name` tells the name of the action upon running- ```
  on:
	  push:
		  branches: ['main']
	  pull_request:
		  branches: ['develop']```
  is the syntax for running the action on certain events

- `jobs` tells the actual aautomation commands group running inside the action, takes a list of jobs that can have a
	- `<job-id>` like `build` that would be running the actions
	- `runs-on` for telling the OS/image the job runs on
	- `strategy: matrix: node-versions: ['20.x', '22.x']` runs the jobon all of these versions
		- `matrix.node_versions` is also available as a global variable that can be used in other places down the action like `${{matrix.node-version}}` (returns which current node version the build was running on, since it runs on all of them in the matrix)
	-  `steps` most jobs are run asynchronously, steps runs the following run keywords inside of it synchronously, one after the other, each step has the following properties:
		- `name` for telling the name of the step
		- `uses` for using an exisiting action repository to use in the place
			- uses like `owner/repo@version_label` or `owner/repo@branch`
			- the repo needs to have an `action.yml` file that will be run whenever the `uses` mentions the action
			- used like this `uses: actions/checkout@v2`
			- This will run the `actions.yml` file in the `checkout` repo by `actions` owner (`actions/checkout` repo) with release version `v2`
		- `run` defines the actual command to run in the actions
		- `with` tells which node vresion to run the particular step on
