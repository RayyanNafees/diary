## Religion
- [Confused Athiests](https://youtu.be/HFp869UmOL0?si=_nel0seQkIObeoTN)
- Those ppl dunno whats th right and wrong way of doing things but they have decided for themselves what is right 
- then they wander around other videos and suggestions to validate wether they think is right or not while claiing a moral high ground, yet hey are confused what is right 
- Firmly believe in your religion and avoid confusion to waste your mental energy... u have got the right path
- They try to push others to join evil cu they love to do so but cant validate themselves that it's right.. so they try to shove in their ideology on others without even knowing that to be an evil act  
- That's how satan plays with their confusion, when u are confused what is right or wrong, it opens satan & your inherent evil conscious (nafs) to take u over
- When there is no trusted guidance, u can't figure out the misguidance disguised as right... u would be confused in making decisions and will look at others to validate your decisions (which many times might not be those upon guidance) and bias always comes into play.. even in AI let alone human brain

## Quick Sites  
- Nothing beats [Astro](https://asrto.build) when it comes to creating quick sites the easiest way... not even [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) or [Lume](https://lume.land)... however I "might" keep [hugo](https://gohugo.io/) in case I come across a very useful theme that can solve my problems aster than having to `npm install` astro dependencies
- Fastest way to design a site look is to learn to Integrate a CMS into it, for Astro, the best one in the market currently is [StoryBlok](https://www.storyblok.com/) which it actively sponsors 
- Learn to convert to-and-from Obsidian to Static Site generators (Each of hugo lume and astro), also thereby connecting a CMS and test for yourself which one was the fastest 
- Learn Github Actions for handling content stored in one repo and displaying it in another... or content in one branch and the static site generation stuff in another, much like what [gh-pages](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gh-pages) do
