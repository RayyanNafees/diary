# Things i learnt today

# 1. React Positively to an event for success
- Change your thoughts
- free them from learned helplessness or acquired despair
- despair is the 2nd most major sin
- Have faith in the Divine Decree
- This can be unlearned
- It all matters how u react to an event, if u react negatively to an event or positively is what makes all the difference
- Like the baby elephant cant escape the chain even when he grows up and becomes a giant
