## Do good even if it's small, and avoid bad even if it is insignificant, or reduce it even if by a small %

U find someone in need, help him for Allah, even if he's bad to u

U find someone not so lively as usual, try to cheer them up - even if they haven't done that for u

U visit a friend/relative's house, take something to eat.. even if it's a bag of chips or chocolate bar - or same if someone comes to visit u :)

U see an obstacle on road, remove it for others

U found a good & easy solution for a problem, share it with others

When u are angry or in a bad mood, try to talk less

If u see smth wrong happening in front of u, atleast say him he's wrong if u cant stop him.. even if he's your close friend - cuz all the evil in this world exists, just cuz it's let to exist

Avoid the thoughts like "if others know it they may get ahead OR everybody is getting ahead from me how will I catch up?", for opportunities to success comes from God alone...

And when the opportunity comes, chase it passionately, for a person at a strong position, has more power to do good and reduce the evil
