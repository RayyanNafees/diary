## Dream @ 6pm
We went to see behen's fiance, was living in a looooong apartment on top floor
 We went down using the lift which felt like we were falling
 
 Then I got stuck on a plant whose leaves were  very long and was hanging for my life on it, was slipping with the danger of falling to the ground head-first
 
 There was one <> in my path, üê´ "oonth-kate" which tried to bite my hand, i thrown others easily just 1 was left which I smashed, and finally then dropped off the leaf. later mom told me it was oonth kate that they eat camel poop
 
 Finally, my sister said yes on leaving and I felt like she knows what she is doing from the response
